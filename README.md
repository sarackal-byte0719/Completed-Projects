# Completed-Projects
Overview

The purpose of these projects to present the scripts I have written in different computer languages. I have organized the projects based on the computer language. 

Features

For R Projects:

I wrote the loops and conditional expressions. 
I can use vectors, logical vectors, character vectors, index vectors, and selecting and modifying subsets of a data set. 
I can construct, modify, and work with lists and data frames. 
I can write loops and conditional expressions. 
I practiced writing scripts for high-level plotting commands.
I built different models, including linear regression models and logistic regression models. 
I was able to generate graphics with ggplot2. 
I used the scripts to solve real-world problems in different projects.
 
For Excel Projects:
I can perform data feature selection, feature elimination, and feature importance using Recursive Feature Elimination, Principal Component Analysis, and Random Forest.
I developed models using supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning techniques such as decision trees, regression trees, neural networks, support vector machines, etc.
I learn to tune model parameters, estimate prediction errors, and model validation.
I compared and ensemble multiple models in the pipeline and automatically select the best model.
	Apply the above techniques to solve business cases.
 
For SQL Projects:
I can use SQL to retrieve data from tables. 
I can use SQL to insert, update, and delete data from tables.
I can use SQL to code queries and subqueries. 
I can handle data types in the database, use queries and functions, regular expressions, and windows procedures. 
I can design simple databases.
I can find information about schemas, tables, and foreign keys.

For Python Projects:
I can manipulate various Python datatypes, such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, lists, and arrays.
I can write your functions using loops and conditional execution.
I can build simple statistical models and data visualizations
I can isolate and fix common errors in Python programs.
I can write small-scale Python programs using the above skills.

o	For Machine Learning Projects: 
I can describe artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in layperson terms.
I can create scripts for the following ML techniques:
Neural networks (biological, artificial, deep, convolutional, autoencoder, generative adversarial).
Genetic algorithms (biological and artificial).
Supervised and unsupervised learning (and hybrid variants).
Decision trees, automated decision trees, and random forests.
Frequent itemsets and recommender systems.
Natural language processing and sentiment analysis.
