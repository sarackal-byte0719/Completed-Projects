# Completed-Projects
Overview
o	The purpose of these projects to present the scripts I have written in different computer languages. I have organized the projects based on the computer language. 

Features
o	For R Projects:
o	I wrote the loops and conditional expressions. 
o	I can use vectors, logical vectors, character vectors, index vectors, and selecting and modifying subsets of a data set. 
o	I can construct, modify, and work with lists and data frames. 
o	I can write loops and conditional expressions. 
o	I practiced writing scripts for high-level plotting commands.
o	I built different models, including linear regression models and logistic regression models. 
o	I was able to generate graphics with ggplot2. 
o	I used the scripts to solve real-world problems in different projects.
 
o	For Excel Projects:
o	I can perform data feature selection, feature elimination, and feature importance using Recursive Feature Elimination, Principal Component Analysis, and Random Forest.
o	I developed models using supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning techniques such as decision trees, regression trees, neural networks, support vector machines, etc.
o	I learn to tune model parameters, estimate prediction errors, and model validation.
o	I compared and ensemble multiple models in the pipeline and automatically select the best model.
o	Apply the above techniques to solve business cases.
 
o	For SQL Projects:
o	I can use SQL to retrieve data from tables. 
o	I can use SQL to insert, update, and delete data from tables.
o	I can use SQL to code queries and subqueries. 
o	I can handle data types in the database, use queries and functions, regular expressions, and windows procedures. 
o	I can design simple databases.
o	I can find information about schemas, tables, and foreign keys.

o	For Python Projects:
o	I can manipulate various Python datatypes, such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, lists, and arrays.
o	I can write your functions using loops and conditional execution.
o	I can build simple statistical models and data visualizations
o	I can isolate and fix common errors in Python programs.
o	I can write small-scale Python programs using the above skills.

o	For Machine Learning Projects: 
o	I can describe artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in layperson terms.
o	I can create scripts for the following ML techniques:
o	Neural networks (biological, artificial, deep, convolutional, autoencoder, generative adversarial).
o	Genetic algorithms (biological and artificial).
o	Supervised and unsupervised learning (and hybrid variants).
o	Decision trees, automated decision trees, and random forests.
o	Frequent itemsets and recommender systems.
o	Natural language processing and sentiment analysis.
